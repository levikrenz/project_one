I watched some youtube videos that helped a lot with this project especially with getting the api key and how to actually use it.
there is an error if you try to type a city that doesn't exist, and i'm not really sure how to make a failsafe for that.
The api key expires dec 16 if you need a new one you can go to www.weatherbit.io to get a free one
